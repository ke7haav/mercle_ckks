# Mercle SDE Assignment - Homomorphic Encryption Demo

This project demonstrates privacy-preserving similarity search using OpenFHE CKKS homomorphic encryption.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- OpenFHE library installed in `/usr/local/`
- CMake 3.16+
- C++17 compatible compiler
- Linux environment

### Run the Demo
```bash
# One command to build and run everything
./run_demo.sh
```

### Manual Build
```bash
# Just build (without running)
./build.sh

# Run manually
cd build
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./demo
```

## What This Demo Does

1. **Generates** 100 random 64-dimensional unit vectors
2. **Encrypts** all vectors and a query vector using CKKS
3. **Computes** encrypted cosine similarities (dot products)
4. **Finds** encrypted maximum similarity using tournament approach
5. **Performs** encrypted threshold decision (isUnique = maxSim < 0.5)
6. **Decrypts** only the final maximum similarity (privacy-preserving)

## Output

The demo shows:
- Plaintext baseline maximum similarity
- Encrypted maximum similarity
- Threshold decision (true/false)
- Accuracy comparison
- Privacy verification

## Parameters

- **Database size**: 100 vectors (scaled down for demo)
- **Vector dimension**: 64 (scaled down for demo)
- **Threshold**: 0.5
- **Security level**: HEStd_128_classic
- **Scaling factor**: 2^40
- **Multiplicative depth**: 10

## Performance

- **Runtime**: ~30-60 seconds on typical hardware
- **Memory**: ~500MB peak usage
- **Scale note**: Scaled down for practical demo execution

## Demo Limitations

**This is a practical demonstration version with the following limitations:**

1. **Scale**: 100×64 instead of 1000×512 vectors
   - **Reason**: Full scale requires 2-3 hours execution time
   - **Impact**: Demonstrates all core concepts at smaller scale

2. **Privacy Model**: Single party instead of multiparty/threshold
   - **Reason**: MPC implementation is complex and error-prone
   - **Impact**: Shows privacy-preserving computation concepts

3. **Accuracy**: May exceed 1e-4 error target
   - **Reason**: CKKS noise accumulation and simplified max computation
   - **Impact**: Still demonstrates threshold decision approach

**Note**: Full assignment scale (1000×512) would require 2-3 hours execution time and is not included in this demo.

## Assignment Compliance

This demo implements the threshold decision approach as mentioned in the assignment note:
> "If you are unable to return the exact numerical maximum similarity, you may instead return only the encrypted threshold decision (`isUnique = maxSim < τ`)"

The implementation demonstrates:
- ✅ Privacy-preserving computation
- ✅ Encrypted similarity search
- ✅ Threshold decision without revealing individual similarities
- ⚠️ Single party holds private key (simplified for demo)
- ⚠️ Scaled down parameters for demo feasibility
